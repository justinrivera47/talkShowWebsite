# talkShowWebsite


Hello! Thank you for taking the time to review my personal project. 

I am applying knowledge that I have learned from Lambda School and other resources that I have accumulated over time. 

The purpose of this website is to create a fluid design website for a talk show. I might possibly use this in the future for a potential client.

I'm focused more on the HTML and the CSS documentation and will add JS eventually. 

I hope you like what you see. 

Thank you.
